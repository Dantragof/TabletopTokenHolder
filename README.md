# What is this?
This is printable token holder for use in tabletop gaming.

# Why do I need it?
Because you are either:
1) tired of re-using the same monsters just because you have minis
2) running out of storage space for minis
3) dislike collecting paper tokens from all over the room after a door-generated gust of wind
4) dislike using nondescriptive generic tokens like colored circles and squares

# How do I use this?
1) You print, say, five token holders of sizes you need (as many as you will have on the table at the same time)
2) You prepare a stack of paper portraits for all monsters you want in your game
3) You place whatever portraits you want into the token holders
4) You play whatever tabletop you play

# What printers are suitable?
I tested all prototypes and the final token holder using Anycubic Photon S SLA printer using stock Anycubic black resin. I cannot vouch for other printers and resins, but I think most SLA printers will do. I do not know if FDM printers are capable of printing this as I do not have one and I suspect there could be problems due to print size.

# Token sizes
The holders are supposed to represent a certain tabletop game's differently sized creatures: small, medium, and large ones.

Medium holder has an outer radius of 1" (12.7mm radius), and its tokens are supposed to have a radius between 8.76mm and 10.55mm, giving a 1.79mm radial tolerance for a bad scissor technique.

Small holder's respective dimensions are 0.8" / 10.16 mm / 6.22mm / 8.01mm / 1.79mm.

Large holder's respective dimensions are 1.75" / 22.23mm / 18.29mm / 20.08mm / 1.79mm.

# Notes
1) Wait until covid is done until you gather for play, unless you live with people you play with.
2) Use all standard precautions required for SLA printing, resins are toxic until they are fully cured.
